Howdy :wave:

This here is my data wranglin' repo :cowboy_hat_face: :horse: :cow:

In the s04 file I explore select(), arrange(), filter(), and mutate().

In the s05 file I explore summarize/summarise(). I also combine the functions from s04 with ggplot. 

In s07, I practice joins, (which tbh was one of the hardest things for me to learn). E.g.:
* inner_join()
* anti_join()
* full_join()
